==+== C. Paper summary

(written in 2010)

Network on chip is a growing trend that interconnects a multitude of cores together. Packets are sent across the network and arbitration strategies (round-robin or oldest-priority) are employed to share critical resources. Multi-core dies popularity is going-up due to parallelized computing and we need to account for the upcoming bottleneck of packet transmission, which doesn't account for system performance. Hence the need to (1) classify packets by their application-criticalness, (2) find a convenient algorithm that gives room to fairness and (3) scale it to an arbitrary memory-sharing model and network size.

Aergia estimates the slack of each outgoing packets and classifies them with an order of priority determined by three metrics: number of hops to reach its destination, number of preceding L2 misses, and whether or not the new packet is a L2 miss or it. Arbitration and network interface use those priorities to speedup the most critical packets at a given time.

Their method focus and can be merged with parallelism-aware memory scheduling to reach even higher overall performance improvements.

==+== D. Comments for author

The slack quantization method is clearly efficient and grouping into batches is to prevent starvation is smart as well.

The presentation of the weighted sum (priority-bits) is lackluster, it needs a higher-level overview (figure?) to comprehend the "bin division" and how/where the packets are exactly being sorted.

Otherwise, it seems that it could be useful to put metrics on several additions that have been made: piggy-backing of the miss/hit to travelling packets, area overhead, energy consumption both to the router and network.

Figure 5. an explanation of "unfairness" and how you measure it would be helpful. It seems that STC and Aeria have approximately the same speedup, only combining them makes a little improvement.

# Strength

- Combinable to parallelism aware memory scheduling for further improvement
- Simple yet effective slack quantization method
- Angle of attack not touched upon by previous work

# Weaknesses

- Many self-references in the literature
- Code/ressources to reproduct non available which is an issue due to the rather short evaluation
- Short evaluation

==+== Scratchpad (for unsaved private notes)

Network on chip employs simple arbitration stategies such as round robin or oldest first, whch treat packets.

slack is a key measure for charaterizong a packet relative importance

aergia introduces new router prioritiyationpolicies that exploit interfering packets availableslack to improve overall system perforamnce and fairmess



arbitration poloci to teart allincoming  paackets and prioritize the output not depending on age or round robin fashino

AEGERIA
not all load miss cause bottlenecjs

packet slack = nb of cycles it can be delayed in the network withot affecting the application execution time

estimate available slack before transferring packet and

batch system to prevent startvation and atalling progress

MOTIVATION
run-ahead and out of order execution
MLP on on-chip network lead to packet latency overlap

accelerate packets with a small slack

SLACK estimation
local slack -> nb of cycles a packet can be delayed without delaying subsequent intructions
gloabl slack -> nb of cyclces a packet can be delayed without delaying the last instruction in the program

FOCUS ON LOCAL SLACK
consider slack only with respect to outstanding network transactions
predecessor packets for a packet P all the packets that are still outstanding and that have ben injected by te same ore into te network earlier than P

-- 1 could be #predecessors

key challenge is to estimate the slack
-> difficult to do
-> categoriye and quantize slack into different priority levels according to indrect metrics
-> most important factors are the nb of predecessors that are L2 hit or miss, nb of a pacet's extra hops in the network
-> relation between predecessors L2 miss to future slack
-> 3rd metric is nb of hops in the network

tagging of the packet ead wih priority bits 

every core maintains a list of outstanding L1 load misses

each L1 miss is associated with  a corresponding L2 miss status bit
control packets to send back L2 miss or hits to cores
piggy backing of the information to already travelling packets 

L2 miss or hit predictor in each core to guess injected packets cache hit miss status

-> global branch predictor
-> threshold predictor (misses occur inbursts)

NoC architecture
starvatuin avoidance (using batching) and mitigating priority inversion (multiplenetwork interface queues)

Baseline

Arbtration
aergia, virtual channel arbitration and swich arbitration units prioritize packets with lower slack priority levels.
low slack packets get preference for buffers and crossbar -> they are accelerated

packets from older batches are prioritized from the ones with younger batches

network interface is devided into sevaral equal length queue that store packets depenind on their priority

Network interface

Aergia optimizes system throughput by explotiing packet slack
