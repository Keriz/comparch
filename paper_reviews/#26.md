The goal is this paper is to demonstrate that the future goal will be to have main memories act as caches.
Logic In Memry arays ould be associative 
could be used for error-code correcting aimplementation and sorting
how a class of logic in memory arrays can be used as high soeed buffer memories 
mempory management tecghniques well proven in practive that hide the latency to access the slower, magnetic drum or disc based memory insyead of the microelectronic technologies

Describes the cache/main memory interfaacer
argues that slwoer memories are still OK because of the cache mechanisms that can be implemented
move instructions issued to the array of caches which are supposed to withhold all the data needed to perform the operations


Proposes new operations with a sector memory address, memory address, operands 

Search on mask equality, masked thresold ( > or >=)
Copy tag bit
Sector ADD/Scale 

Actual utility of aforementioned operations is to be seen, as it is effectively hard for a programmer and a compiler to translate the assembly code into the correct operations to take as much profit as possible of these logic-in-memory.
Shift of thoughts: instructions are sent to control the cache, but rather to manipulaet the data in the memory.

--- mechanism that is indepent is transfering the data uin the cache as necessary ( today's prefetching)


++ cache is invisible to the programs (no control commands sent ahead to help the cache to organize its data)

Mentions the utility for matrix multiplications (ex Gauss-Joradan erduction for matrix inversion)



//// New access mode in the memory
Bit(s) slice of data to be accessed (from multiple words at a time) -? a very large number of words can be accessed simulnateously to peform logical operations, by sector on the data in the cache (mxn opertations SIMUL)0)

Sumarry and conclusion

Diverging from the von Neumann organization, provided that the cost of cache processing remains low
High level languages give a subset of instructions to the programmer and less access to the machine being programmed
parallel development of languages and computers
